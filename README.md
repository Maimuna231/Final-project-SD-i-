# MR. SPROUTY



## Project Description
**MR. SPROUTY** is a text-based interactive virtual pet game developed using **C programming**.  
In this game, the player receives a **mystery seed box** containing a hidden plant. The plant type is unknown at the beginning and must be identified by observing how it reacts to care actions.

The player can water the plant or give it sunlight. Each plant responds differently, affecting its happiness level and growth stage. Based on these clues, the player can guess the correct plant type.

This project combines basic game logic with core C programming concepts in an engaging way.
